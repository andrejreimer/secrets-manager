# secrets-manager
Visual Studio Extension to manage user secrets for different environments

# Motivation
Working on different customer projects I ended up maintaining several user secrets files in each project to be able to switch databases and other connectivity configuration towards API. 

# What it does
This extension allows you to manage different user secrets files per project and switch them in Visual Studio without interupting your work.
